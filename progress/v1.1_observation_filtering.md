# v1.1 — Observation Filtering (EMA)

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Goal:** Test if simple exponential moving average (EMA) filtering can reduce noise impact.

## Method
- Apply EMA filter: `filtered = alpha * new_obs + (1 - alpha) * prev_filtered`
- Alpha = 0.25 (heavy smoothing)

## Results

| Noise Level | Baseline Success | Filtered Success | Delta |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Medium      | 92.5%           | 95.0%           | +2.5% |
| High        | 67.5%           | 55.0%           | -12.5% |
| Extreme     | 17.1%           | 18.1%           | +1.0% |

**Key finding:** EMA filtering barely helps and can even hurt under high noise.
The problem is that EMA introduces lag — the robot reacts to old observations.
